The parameter server model was developed for running machine-learning algorithms like sparse logistic regression (§ 5.1).

What do you expect the bottleneck – that is, the most loaded – resource (e.g., CPU, memory, network) to be at the workers and at the servers?

What resource utilization would you likely observe if using Spark's logistic regression (see §3.2.1 in the Spark paper) instead of the parameter server for the experiment in §5.1?
